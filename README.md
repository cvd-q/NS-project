# Network modeling for COVID-19 spread

This repository contains the python code for generating a real-world network and simulating the spread of an infectious disease in the network under different lockdown and transmission scenarios. The parameters and code blocks are modified for the case of COVID-19 but they can be edited to reflect the spread of any other infectious disease. Detailed methods are explained in [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09189)
